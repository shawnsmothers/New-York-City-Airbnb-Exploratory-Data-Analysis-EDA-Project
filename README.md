# New-York-City-Airbnb-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project
### Description:
This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a New York City Airbnb dataset containing over 20,000 rows of information about various Airbnb listings. The goal was to gain insights into the characteristics and trends of the listings, identify correlations, and understand the data structure before moving into further predictive modeling or decision-making tasks.

### Project Overview
Dataset Description
The dataset contains essential information such as:

Room types (e.g., private room, entire home/apt, shared room)
Geographical location (latitude and longitude)
Pricing and availability information
Number of reviews and review frequency per listing
Key Steps and Insights
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to remove missing values, handle outliers, and ensure consistency in column formats and naming conventions. Unique values were analyzed to better understand categorical variables like neighbourhood_group and room_type.

Univariate Analysis: Analyzed individual features to explore their distributions and central tendencies. The analysis showed that the majority of listings fall into two primary room types: private room and entire home/apartment.

Bivariate Analysis: Investigated relationships between pairs of variables. Key findings included:

A weak positive correlation between price and the number of beds.
Spatial distribution analysis revealed that most properties are located between latitude 40.6 to 40.8 and longitude 73.8 to 74.0.
Multivariate Analysis: Extended the exploration to multiple variables to understand complex interactions. For instance, a strong relationship was identified between the number of reviews and reviews per month, which was expected as more reviews tend to increase review frequency.

### Key Takeaways
This EDA not only helped uncover significant insights but also provided a clear understanding of the data structure, which will be crucial for further analysis and modeling. The findings reveal trends in property types, spatial locations, and pricing strategies for Airbnb hosts in NYC.
